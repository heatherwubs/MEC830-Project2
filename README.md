The objective of this project was to design a robotic car, and implement a program for the robotic car to complete 3 different tasks with a group. For the first task, the car was to be moved manually with the help of a joystick through the path outlined in Figure 1.1. The car was required to move from point ‘p0’ to ‘p3’ as indicated with the red line. Room was allowed for error during the navigation process. The second task required the system to navigate through the same path in Figure 1.1, but autonomously, without any manual input. Finally, the third Task involves the autonomous avoidance of an object to reach an arbitrary finish position (dependent upon the length of the system), with the general outline of motion showcased in Figure 1.2.

These tasks were completed using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and with the electronic components that can be found within the Elegoo UNO Starter Kit. With the attached microcontroller board and multiple other components like actuators and sensors, the above mentioned tasks were successfully completed and a detailed analysis of the components used, are showcased in the following sections. The main restriction of this project is to only utilize components that are included within the kit, and also spend as little as possible to construct the moving system, while demonstrating the knowledge and understanding of microcontrollers and sub-components gained during the progression of this course.
